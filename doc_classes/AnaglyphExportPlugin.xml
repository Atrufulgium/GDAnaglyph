	<brief_description>
		Editor plugin that ensures exported builds have Anaglyph in the right place.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		[b]Note:[/b] You should not need to use this class directly at any point.
		The following directory structure is enforced by both this extension and Anaglyph itself:
		[codeblock lang=text]
		(root)
		├ (Game executable)
		├ (Other files)
		└ Anaglyph
		  ├ .DS_STORE
		  ├ audioplugin_Anaglyph.dll
		  └ anaglyph_plugin_data
		    ├ .DS_Store
		    ├ (ILD .sofa's)
		    ├ (head model .sofa's)
		    ├ (reverb .sofa's)
		    └ (possibly extra user .sofa's)
		[/codeblock]
		This class ensures the files are copied from [code]res://Anaglyph[/code] over to the finished build.
		[b]Warning:[/b] It is currently only tested on Windows. This scheme doesn't even make sense for some exports.
